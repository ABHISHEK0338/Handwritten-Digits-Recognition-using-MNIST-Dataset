Domain Analysis: Handwritten Digits Recognition using MNIST
Domain analysis for the MNIST handwritten digit recognition project involves understanding the context, significance, and nuances of digit classification tasks within real-world and academic applications.

Domain Context:
MNIST Dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0–9), each 28x28 pixels.
It is widely used as a benchmark dataset for image classification and deep learning models.
The goal is to train a model that can correctly identify the digit in each image.

Introduction
STEP 1: Problem Definition
Objective: Classify grayscale images (28x28 pixels) of handwritten digits (0–9).
Goal: Build a model that predicts which digit (0–9) is present in the image.
Type: Multi-class classification problem.

Step 2: Load the Dataset
MNIST is available through libraries like:
tensorflow.keras.datasets
sklearn.datasets *it contains:
60,000 trainig images
10,000 test images
